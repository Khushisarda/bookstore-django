# üìö Bookstore Management System (Assignment 1)

## üìå Project Overview

This project is a simple **Bookstore Management System** built using the Django framework (Python). It allows users to browse books, add them to a shopping cart (using sessions), and includes a custom administration panel for managing the book inventory. The project is fully containerized using Docker and includes a basic Jenkins pipeline definition for CI/CD.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Setup & Run Instructions (Using Docker Compose)

These instructions assume you have Docker and Docker Compose installed and running on your system.

### Step 1: Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Khushisarda/bookstore_project.git
cd bookstore_project

Step 2: Build the Docker Images
docker-compose build

Step 3: Apply Database Migrations
docker-compose run --rm web python manage.py migrate

Step 4: Create a Superuser for Admin Access
docker-compose run --rm web python manage.py createsuperuser

Step 5: Start the Application
docker-compose up

Step 2: Build the Docker Images
docker-compose build

Step 3: Apply Database Migrations
docker-compose run --rm web python manage.py migrate

Step 4: Create a Superuser for Admin Access
docker-compose run --rm web python manage.py createsuperuser

Step 5: Start the Application
docker-compose up

## üê≥ Docker Usage Notes

- All components run inside isolated Docker containers for consistent and reproducible environments.
- The `docker-compose.yml` file includes:
  - `web` service: Runs the Django application.
  - `db` service: Runs the MySQL database server.
- Code is synchronized into the container using the volume mount: `.:/app`
- Port mapping: Port `8000` on your local machine is mapped to port `8000` inside the container.
- Uploaded media files and MySQL database data are persistent across container restarts using volume mounts.
- The application uses **Gunicorn** as the WSGI server inside the production Docker image for better performance.

## ü§ñ Jenkins Usage Notes

- A `Jenkinsfile` is provided at the root of the project to define a basic CI/CD pipeline.
- Pipeline Stages:
  - **Checkout**: Retrieves the project source code from the repository.
  - **Build**: Builds the Docker image for the Django application.
  - **Test**: Runs Django unit tests using `python manage.py test` inside the container.
  - **Deploy**: Placeholder step for future deployment integration.
- Requirements:
  - A Jenkins server must be set up with Docker installed and configured.
- This Jenkins pipeline is intended as a template and can be extended to include additional stages such as automated deployment or notifications.
